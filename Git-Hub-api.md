How does the API handle authentication?  
   
    The server you're trying to access wants to know who is accessing its information - or - when the client needs to know that the server is the system it claims to be. The user / computer has to prove its identity to the server / client. Usually, a server requests an username and/or password. A client, usually, requests a certificate.  
  Do I need to authenticate?
    Yes, but: Authentication does not determine what tasks an individual can or cant do or what files they can see. It merely identifies and verifies who / what the accessor is.
  What can I do with an unauthenticated request?
    View a restricted set of data.
  How can I authenticate my request? (3 ways)
    -Basic.(curl -u "username" https://api.github.com).
    -OAuth2 Token. Set in a header.(curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com).
    -OAuth2 Key/Secret.(curl 'https://api.github.com/users/whatever?client_id=xxxx&client_secret=yyyy').

How do i ask the api for.....

  The profile information for a specific user?
    GET /info/user
  The repository listing for a specific user?
    Get /repo/user
  The recent, public activity for a specific user?

Is there a limit to the number of requests I can make?
       For Oauth you can make 5,000 requests an hour and only 60 unauthenticated requests an hour.
  Is there a way of extending that limit?
    Yes. But it's important to stay with-in the rate limit. You can extend unauthenticated requests by passing your app's client ID and secret as part of the query string starting with curl -i ".......".
  What happens when I hit the limit?
    You are notified with a 403 forbidden and an explanation at the bottom of the response. If you abuse the limit you could be temporarily blocked from content creation.
What if there is a lot of data returned?
    It will be paginated to 30 items by default.
