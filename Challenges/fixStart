// Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with '*', except for the first character of itself. you can assume that the string is at least one character long. Example:

// fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
// appendStr


var take = "take two tokens";
var doIt = "*";

function fixStart() {
    for (doIt = 0; doIt < 1; doIt++)
    if ("t")
    console.log("*" )
}

fixStart()
