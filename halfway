          I didnt know how (or really what) a html file was until i first started my prework in january. 
I look back on what i thought of programming versus the understanding i now have and there are so many layers
that i was unaware of. Everything, from vanilla JavaScript, to Jquery, from css to sass, has been has been a new
concept for me. The workload of this course ahs clouded my over-all view of these concepts from time to time. When
you treat assignments like the enemy you lose scope on what these principles are: tools. Javascript wasnt created 
to test me - it was created to make life easier (debatable) for those who seek to create new things. Then there's 
JQuery, another layer that seeks to simplify JavaScript and in many ways make it more powerful. Each loop just wants 
to help!

          My first month of The Iron yard i would jump into these projects blind. I would just push through them,
having faith that i would somehow complete the assignment. It's not a bad thing to have that level of determination,
but you have to have a plan to invest the energy in. My challenge from the start has been planning and along the way I 
have made leaps. I'm begginning to block time for research, deep focus, discussion, and breaks. I'm talking my way 
through functions, pseudo-coding even if the pseudo looks foreign to me, making documents DRY. I dont have everything
in place, I still forget to plan appropriately, I'm still figuring out my style for approaching problems in the development 
world. All of this progress isnt made willy-nilly. I've aknowleged problems and moments that could have been simpler
or shouldn't have been as stressful and have implemented processes that refine them. It's still difficult to initialize and 
follow through on a plan but I'm now much better at identifying situations where one should be in place.
