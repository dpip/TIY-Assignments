How does the API handle authentication?  
    The server you're trying to access wants to know who is accessing its information - or - when the client needs to know that the server is the system it claims to be. The user / computer has to prove its identity to the server / client. Usually, a server requests an username and/or password. A client, usually, requests a certificate.  
  
  Do I need to authenticate?
    Yes, but: Authentication does not determine what tasks an individual can or cant do or what files they can see. It merely identifies and verifies who / what the accessor is.
  
  What can I do with an unauthenticated request?
    Research the error number.
